## Licensing

By contributing to Arc, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under:

- **GPL-3.0-or-later** for compiler code (`compiler/` directory)  
- **MIT License** for standard library, tools, examples, and documentation

This dual-licensing approach ensures:
- Compiler improvements benefit the entire community
- Users can freely use Arc in their projects without licensing concerns
- The project remains sustainable and open

All contributors must agree to license their contributions under these terms.
For significant contributions, we may ask you to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
